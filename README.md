# First Laboratory Assignment
**Exercise 1 in English** - due no later than **on 2024-10-24**, this exercise is **optional**  
Write a program - secure notepad - the access to which will be secured by a password. After providing the password, the user should be able to display the stored note, change it, change the password. Providing an incorrect password should of course result in lack of access to the note and any possibility of changing the password. Avoid putting comments which identify you in the source code of your application (the code can be published, and the professor prefers to publish personal data only after explicit agreement; if you want them published, feel free to sign your name in the comments). 

Please send in your source code in a zip file to the professor, in a message with a **subject:  
BSM - prostykod - {studentnumber} {lastname} {firstname}**  
(Do not send in < nor > characters, and of course put in your owe personal information. Your student number has only numbers in it - no letters.)  
The body of the message is irrelevant. You can e.g. put in your comments regarding this lab in iambic pentameter, but you can also leave it blank.
